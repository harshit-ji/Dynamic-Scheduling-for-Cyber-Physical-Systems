# Dynamic-Scheduling-for-Cyber-Physical-Systems
This project is in collaboration with a bengaluru based company called Ace Micromatics Manufacturing Tntelligence Technologies (AMIT). This project is based on finding the solution for inefficiencies in manufacturing due to the complex nature of the components production this company handles. It is a problem of low volume high variety production scheduling where there are n jobs and 3m machines. This means that for each job and each operation a total of three (multiple) machines are available for each operation. This project is currently in progress. One part of this project is completed which includes developing sequencing algorithms and machine allocation algorithms for static scheduling.
